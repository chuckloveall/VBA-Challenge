# VBA-Challenge

<h2>Starting and Finished Excel Files are too large to upload to Github.

Created a VBA script to loop through the stock data for a year returning the stock ticker, yearly total volume traded, yearly change in opening versus closing price, and percent change in price.
Applied conditional formatting with red being negative and green being positive.
Added an additional summary table section providing greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume.
The script will work across all sheets that have stock ticker data in the following columns:
- ticker
- date
- open
- high
- low
- close
- volume

Unique ticker symbols and other summary data will then be added in columns I:L. Greatest % change and totals will be added in columns N:P.
